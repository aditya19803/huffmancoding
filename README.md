# huffmancoding
Huffman coding algorithm is a lossless data compression algorithm that assigns shorter binary codes to more frequent characters, reducing the overall size of the data while preserving its original content.

Given repository consists a Huffman code implemented in python, and a sample text about National Institute of Technology for implementation of the code

We have a Huffman class in the given code. So create a object for the class using file location as argument and use the compress and decompress options given in the code.
You will have a new file which is compressed will be renamed as compressed file and will be in the sample folder as the sample.txt. Use the decompress function also in the same way.
